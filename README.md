montague
========

`montague` is a little CCG semantic parsing library for Scala.

Awesome examples coming soon.

### TODO

- Low-level unit tests
- High-level tests for parsing and semantic comprehension (i.e. the things now in `SemanticParser#main`)
- Add pretty examples to the readme
- Cleanup of UPSHOT-specific code
- Bring in a simplified version of the SQL-specific stuff from UPSHOT
- Some more in-depth fun examples - e.g. game logic? SQL-like?
