 * This is either a lambda, or a completed state.
 * It can be in the Lambda state, where it is waiting for arguments.
 * Or it can be in a Form state, where it has all the arguments it wants, and is fully resolved as a predicate.
 * Example:
 *  "biotechnology" starts as Lambda state lambda x, waiting for an argument.
 *  When it takes an argument, it returns filter(x, BasePredicate(industry = biotech)), which is a Form.
 *
 * SemanticStates consume *one* argument at a time (they are curried).
